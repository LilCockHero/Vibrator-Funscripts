# Vibrator-Funscripts
A custom script to use on [funscript.io](https://funscript.io/modify) to adapt a cock hero funscipt for vibrator toys like the Gush

As a result, the toy will emit a "pulse" for each beat

# Usage
First you need a "half speed" script (where each beat correspond to exactly one pos in the script), you can generate one from a beat-track audio file using the fist option in this post : https://milovana.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=24040

Then you go on [funscript.io](https://funscript.io/modify), upload your script, add a custom modifier and paste the content of script.js inside. Apply the custom function, save your new script and you're done

# Examples
You can find examples of scripts generated with this method in the funscripts folder
